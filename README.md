# Introbots

#### Favara edition

## Getting your Arduino ready

You will need a few libraries in your Arduino environment. I have packed them up as a zipfile that you can find here called `libraries-arduino.zip`.

To install them simply uncompress that zipfile onto your `~/Documents/Arduino` folder. You have to do that before you start the Arduino programming environment.

## What code should we load on the bots?

When you download this repo you will be getting a bunch of stuff, but the primary sketch for the *introbots* is named `introbot_may`.

## What libraries are these?

You will need the Chrono, Metro and corestats libraries in your Arduino environment.
